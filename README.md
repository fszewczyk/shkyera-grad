<i>micrograd, but in C++ and with more functionality.</i>

This is a small header-only library of a scalar-valued autograd based on [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). It provides a high-level, PyTorch-like API for creating simple neural networks.

## Usage

Make sure your compiler supports C++17. Shkyera Grad is a header-only library, so the only thing you need to do is to include it in your project.

```cpp
#include "include/ShkyeraGrad.hpp"
```

Check out the [examples](examples/README.md) for a quick start on Shkyera Grad.
